# chickengame

This is MATLAB code for playing iterative chicken game against the artificial agent.

## How to use
1. Set parameters.

 * Parameters for behavior of the artificial agents (alpha, beta, gamma, theta) in 'averageSimul.m'
 * The number of trials (default: 50) in 'averageSimul.m'
 * reward scale (default: -1000 300 -300 0) in 'cox_mutulP_simul.m' and 'randsum_simul.m'
 
2. Run 'averageSimul'.

3. After 'Loading' is end, countdown of 3 sec starts after 'Ready' sign. Press any button on a keyboard to avoid in 3 sec. 

4. After all trials finished, behavioral responses are saved as 'result.mat'.
